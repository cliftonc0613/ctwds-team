## Department Overview

| Department | Agents | Skills | Invoke |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Marketing | 8 | 34 (`coreyhaines31/marketingskills`) | See `ai-marketing-team.md` |
| Blog | 8 | 30 (`/blog` engine) | See `ai-blog-team.md` |
| SEO | 8 | 24 (`/seo` engine) | See `ai-seo-team.md` |
| Ads | 8 | 18 (`/ads` engine) | See `ai-ads-team.md` |
| Work | 3 | 3 plugins (`anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins`) | See `ai-work-team.md` |
| Social | 3 | `charlie947/social-media-skills` | See `ai-social-team.md` |
| Design | 3 | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `impeccable`, `taste-design`/`design-taste-frontend`, `transitions-dev` | See `ai-design-team.md` |
| QA | — | 1 (`/qa-personas`) | See `qa-skills.md` |

`dev` (Superpowers, Context7, Claude-Mem, 97-dev) from the installer is agency infrastructure — debugging discipline, doc lookup, session memory — not a client-facing department with its own agents/cadence, so it has no team doc.

`astro-business-builder` (site scaffolding — installed separately, not part of `install-claude-company-os.sh`) is grouped alongside `dev` tooling for the same reason: it's a capability invoked directly, not a department with daily/weekly cadences or agent handoffs. Its skill reference lives in `site-builder-skills.md`.

**Reference files in this folder:**
- `marketing-skills.md` + `ai-marketing-team.md`
