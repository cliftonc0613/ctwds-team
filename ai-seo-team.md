# AI SEO Team — Operational Playbook

8 specialized AI agents powered by the `/seo` skill engine.
Each agent owns a domain, runs daily and weekly duties, and hands off to other agents as needed.
Full audits deploy up to 18 parallel AI agents under the hood.

---

## Agent 1: Technical Auditor

**Specialty:** Site health, crawlability, Core Web Vitals, and ongoing drift monitoring

**Skills:** `seo-audit`, `seo-technical`, `seo-page`

### Daily Tasks
| Task | Skill | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Crawl health check | `seo-technical` | Scan for new 404s, indexability issues, redirect chains, and canonical errors |
| Core Web Vitals monitor | `seo-technical` | Check CWV regressions on high-traffic pages vs. prior baseline |
| Drift detection | `seo-technical` | Compare on-page signals against the prior audit run; flag any deltas |

### Weekly Tasks
| Task | Skill | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Full site audit | `seo-audit` | Run 9-agent parallel audit, produce 0-100 health score, prioritize issues by severity |
| Technical category sweep | `seo-technical` | Deep audit across all 9 technical categories: crawlability, security, mobile, structured data, etc. |
| Page-level deep dives | `seo-page` | Analyze 3-5 underperforming pages for on-page issues |
| Baseline update | `seo-audit` | Re-run the full audit after any significant publish or site change to reset the comparison baseline |
| Technical issue tracker | — | Compile prioritized issue log from audit outputs for Strategy Lead |

> No installed skill does dedicated baseline-diff drift monitoring (the old `seo drift` placeholder had no real equivalent) — `seo-technical`/`seo-audit` re-runs are the closest substitute; comparing scores/issues run-over-run is manual.

### Key Outputs
- Weekly 0-100 site health score report
- Prioritized technical issue tracker (severity-ranked)
- Drift comparison notes (run-over-run delta from `seo-audit`/`seo-technical`)
- Per-page on-page analysis for underperformers

### Handoffs
- **Receives from:** Strategy Lead (new pages or URLs to monitor), Content & E-E-A-T Specialist (newly published content for technical review)
- **Hands off to:** Schema Specialist (pages with structured data issues), Strategy Lead (health score trends, crawl anomalies), Data & Intelligence Analyst (performance data for reporting)

| Thin content identification | `seo-content` | Flag pages below quality threshold for rewrite or consolidation |

> No dedicated `seo sxo` skill is installed — SERP-format analysis is folded into `seo-content`. `seo flow` doesn't exist either; `blog-flow` is the closest real skill (built for blog content, but the FLOW methodology applies to any page).

**Daily standup order:** Data & Intelligence Analyst → Technical Auditor → Schema Specialist → Content & E-E-A-T Specialist → AI Search Specialist → Competitor & Growth Strategist → Local & Maps Specialist → International SEO Manager

**Weekly sync:** Strategy Lead reviews all 8 agent outputs to set priorities for the following week. Technical Auditor's health score and Data & Intelligence Analyst's ranking report are the two primary inputs.

---

## Audit Pipeline (Full Site)

```
Data & Intelligence Analyst   → GSC baseline, backlink snapshot, live SERP data
Technical Auditor             → 0-100 health score + prioritized issue list
Schema Specialist             → structured data validation + sitemap check
Content & E-E-A-T Specialist  → quality assessment + thin content flags
AI Search Specialist          → GEO/AIO citation readiness + cluster gaps
Competitor & Growth Strategist → programmatic health + comparison page gaps
Local & Maps Specialist       → GBP + geo-grid rank snapshot (if local)
International SEO Manager     → hreflang validation (if multilingual)
```

Every audit moves left to right. Findings from each agent feed the next agent's context before Strategy Lead receives the consolidated report.
