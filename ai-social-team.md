# Social Team — Operational Playbook

3 specialized AI agents powered by `charlie947/social-media-skills`.
Each agent owns a domain and hands off to other agents — and heavily to the Marketing and Blog departments, since social content overlaps with `marketing-skills:social-content` and Blog's Distribution Manager.

> **Note:** Exact skill/command names inside the plugin are not fully enumerated by the installer. Tasks below are structured around the installer's explicit notes (voice-builder runs first; post-scorer and reels-scripting need API keys) — confirm real command names after install and update this file.

## Agent 1: Voice Builder / Brand Agent

**Specialty:** Brand voice foundation — every other social skill depends on this agent's output

**Skills:** `voice-builder`

### Daily Tasks
| Task | Skill | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Voice consistency spot check | `voice-builder` | Verify today's published posts match the established voice profile |

### Weekly Tasks
| Task | Skill | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Voice profile review | `voice-builder` | Re-run voice-builder if brand positioning shifted; refresh the voice profile all other agents read from |
| Cross-platform tone audit | `voice-builder` | Confirm tone consistency across Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and X while allowing platform-native format differences |

### Key Outputs
- Voice profile (read by every other social skill)
- Weekly tone consistency audit

### Handoffs
- **Receives from:** Marketing Strategy Lead (brand positioning updates), Blog Strategy Lead (BRAND.md / VOICE.md context)
- **Hands off to:** Platform Content Agent (voice profile — required before any content generation), Social Analytics Agent (voice baseline for scoring context)

**⚠️ Must run before any other social agent produces content.**

## Agent 2: Platform Content Agent

**Specialty:** Per-platform post and video content creation

**Skills:** `post-formatter`, `post-writer`, `hook-generator`, `reels-scripting`, `quote-post`, `gemini-carousel`

### Daily Tasks
| Task | Skill | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Daily post batch | `post-writer`, `post-formatter` | Draft 1-3 posts per active platform aligned with the content calendar |
| Reels/Shorts script | `reels-scripting` | Script one short-form video for the day's priority platform |

### Weekly Tasks

| Repurpose intake | — | Pull cornerstone blog posts and ad creative angles into platform-native social formats (also see Blog's `blog-repurpose`) |

> Original per-platform names (`instagram-content`, `tiktok-content`, `linkedin-content`, `x-content`) aren't installed skills — `post-writer` + `post-formatter` cover drafting and platform-native formatting instead.

### Key Outputs
- Weekly post library (per platform, format-native)

- Content calendar fill for the week

### Handoffs
- **Receives from:** Voice Builder / Brand Agent (voice profile), Blog Distribution Manager (cornerstone posts to repurpose), Ads Creative Director (winning ad angles as content ideas)

| Underperformer review | `post-scorer` | Flag low-scoring post formats/topics for the Platform Content Agent to avoid repeating |
